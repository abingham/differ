1. Look into a possible git diff option to remove the last line info message...
\\ No newline at end of file
Looked. Found nothing....

2. Look into the --word-diff option
File was
1aaa bbb ccc ddd eee
2ddd
3eee
4ggg hhh iii jjj
5hhh
6iii
7jjj

File now
1aaa bbIb ccc ddd ee

However..... [git diff --help] has this...
Show words as [-removed-] and {+added+}.
Makes no attempts to escape the delimiters
if they appear in the input, so the output may
be ambiguous.





4. Look into using git diff option
  --unified=0
which will show the diff without any context lines.
In other words, output like this...

with --unified=0 it looks like in S,L the L is redundant since its the same

So with this, -3,2 means 'ccc' and 'CCC' were the two lines
deleted from line numbers 3 and 4. aaa=1 bbb=2

The old file was
1aaa
2bbb
3ccc
4CCC

The new file is
1aaa
2bbb

So what does -6 +5 mean?
 -6,1 +5,1
We deleted 'fff' from line 6 in the old-file
We added   'ggg' to   line 5 in the new-file
