1. Look into using git diff option
  --unified=0
which will show the diff without any context lines.
In other words, output like this...

diff --git a/diamond.h b/diamond.h
index a737c21..49a3313 100644
--- a/diamond.h
+++ b/diamond.h
@@ -1,8 +1,8 @@
 #ifndef DIAMOND
 #define DIAMOND

-#include <strin>
+#include <string>

-void diamond(char)
+void diamond(char);

 #endif
\\ No newline at end of file

Would not include lines that start with a single blank space...

diff --git a/diamond.h b/diamond.h

2. Look into a possible git diff option to remove the last line info message...
\\ No newline at end of file
